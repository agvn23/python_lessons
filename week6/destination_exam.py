"""
QUESTION : You are given an array, paths, where each element paths[i] = [cityAᵢ, cityBᵢ] represents a direct route from cityAᵢ to cityBᵢ. Your task is to identify the final city on the route—the one that has no outgoing path to any other city. The structure of the routes is guaranteed to be a simple chain without loops, so there will be exactly one such destination.

Example 1:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"], ["New York","Lima"], ["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
Explanation: You travel from “London” to “Sao Paulo” as follows: “London” -> “New York” -> “Lima” -> “Sao Paulo”. The city “Sao Paulo” has no outgoing route, so it’s the destination.
Example 2:

Input: paths = [["B","C"], ["D","B"], ["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: Possible routes include “D” -> “B” -> “C” -> “A”, showing that “A” is the final city without any outgoing path.
Example 3:

Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"
Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 100
paths[i].length == 2
1 <= cityAᵢ.length, cityBᵢ.length <= 10
cityAᵢ != cityBᵢ
All city names consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and spaces.
